        <p>Classic italian potato salad with green onions and parsley</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt</li>

            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>

            <li>2, green onions (white part only), chopped</li>

            <li>&half; cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li> 

            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.

            <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.</li>

            <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.</li>

            <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
        </ol>
